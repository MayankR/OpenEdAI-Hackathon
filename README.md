With the advent of the social age, attention spans of individuals have significantly gone down. It has been observed that when people try to read for long hours, they seldom are able to grasp concepts. But having spent some time reading gives them a false sense of understanding it.
Our application (ReadEx) tackles this problem at its core, while also providing a one stop solution for all reading hardships an avid reader has always dreamt of. Move on to project description to know more.

> How App works?

* ReadEx is an assisted reading application, that helps users continuously gauge their understanding of the material.
* A user can use it just like any other reading application (a pdf reader, a text reader etc)
* While you read through the material, Merlin (our intelligent chatbot) figures out your progress and crafts intelligent questions which pop up as counters at the side of your screen.
* Not only this, ReadEx also tries to be your intelligent encyclopedia. You can scan part of any interesting article and it suggests you a few topics that are closely related to it. You can go ahead and tap the suggestion box to read the same.
* It also comes along with an out of the box search engine, which when given with a search query fetches an appropriate article for the topic.
* Questions you fail to answer automatically move to the flashcards section which you can later revisit to revise concepts.
* Overall, ReadEx, with the wizard Merlin, forms a one stop solution to all your reading hardships
